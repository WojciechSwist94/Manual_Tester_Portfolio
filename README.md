# About me #

Hi my name is Wojtek. I am a communicative, accurate, committed person, focused on learning and personal development. My goal is to develop testing knowledge and technical skills. In my current job, I support the project team in software testing. I participate in daily meetings with the team and take part in testing: functional, regression, retesting, exploratory testing. I am also responsible for maintaining lasting business relationships with existing clients and acquiring new ones. Selling IT support systems and services to customers and business partners. Creating sales proposals and maintaining sales documentation. Organizing and conducting software functionality demonstration meetings and training sessions for current and future users. Gathering initial business requirements and configuring test environments that are provided to customers for testing. Reporting on defects detected during daily work with the software. In my spare time, I develop knowledge in the field of testing and quality assurance topics. I have a broad interest in personal development and automotive mechanics.
