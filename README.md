# JUNIOR SOFTWARE TESTER PORTFOLIO - Wojciech Świst 


# :mag_right: ABOUT ME #

<p align="justify">Hi my name is Wojtek. I am a communicative person, accurate, attentive to details, committed, able to work in a team. I am eager to learn new things and am focused on continuous development of my skills. I have 2 years of experience in the IT industry, related to service desk software implementation, testing and customer support. My goal is to develop my testing knowledge and technical skills. I learn on my own using courses, tutorials, webinars and Udemy marathons in the field and IT. I am currently working with Mentor Waldemar Szafraniec, author of the blog www.wyszkolewas.com.pl</p>

<p align="justify">In my current job, I support the project team in software testing. I participate in daily meetings and take part in testing: functional, regression, retesting. I am also responsible for maintaining lasting business relationships with existing clients, organizing and conducting software functionality presentations and user training sessions. Gathering initial business requirements and configuring test environments that are provided to customers for testing. Reporting on defects detected during the daily operation of the software. During October 2021 to July 2022, I worked as a Junior Software Tester on a contract of mandate. I performed manual testing, reported on detected bugs, created test scenarios and test cases, test reports and updated project documentation.</p>

<p align="justify">In my free time I am interested in personal development in the broadest sense, motorization I like trips to the mountains.</p>
